# About Local Commerce System

This is a university project, carried out by my classmates and I when we were taking a course called 'software quality', the project is aimed at helping small businesses to have a control system for their products, make sales, etc.



# What IDE was the code made in ?

We created this project with the next tools: 

* Visual Studio 2022
* Crystal Reports
* SQL Server 2019

To use it, you must have these tools installed. Also, you need to adjust the database string in visual studio. I also included the sql file for a quick review of the project.
